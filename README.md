# Predicting Outage Duration with Regression Models

By David Chen

# Introduction

In this project, I analyzed a power outage dataset, which covers all instances of power outage from January 2000 to July 2016 in the United States. This dataset is from Purdue University’s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure (https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages). 

The dataset details power outage data, such as outage duration, cause of outage, outage start time. It also contains other relevant information including geographical data, climate data, electric consumption data, etc. 

The question I will be tackling in my analysis will be what are the most critical predictors for outage duration, that is to say, which variables have the largest effect on outage duration length. To do this, I will be building a regression model that finds the variables with the most impact on outage duration. This will be very important for the energy sector, as it allows them to know what exactly to focus on preventing when trying to reduce the length of outages.
